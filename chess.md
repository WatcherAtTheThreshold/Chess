# ♟ Rules of Chess

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. Each player commands an army of 16 pieces with the objective of checkmating the opponent's king.

---

## 🧩 Setup

- The board has 64 squares, alternating light and dark.
- The **bottom-right corner** square should be a light square.
- Each player starts with:
  - 1 King
  - 1 Queen
  - 2 Rooks
  - 2 Bishops
  - 2 Knights
  - 8 Pawns
- **White** pieces start on ranks 1 and 2; **Black** on ranks 7 and 8.
- Queen starts on her own color: **White queen on white**, **Black queen on black**.

## 🪖 Piece Movement

| Piece   | Movement Description |
|---------|----------------------|
| **King**   | 1 square in any direction. |
| **Queen**  | Any number of squares in any direction. |
| **Rook**   | Any number of squares vertically or horizontally. |
| **Bishop** | Any number of squares diagonally. |
| **Knight** | Moves in an “L” shape: 2 squares in one direction + 1 square perpendicular. Jumps over pieces. |
| **Pawn**   | 1 square forward (or 2 from starting rank); captures 1 square diagonally forward. |

## ♟ Special Rules

### 1. **Castling**
- A move involving the king and either rook.
- Conditions:
  - Neither the king nor the rook has moved.
  - No pieces between them.
  - The king is not in check, nor passes through or ends up in check.
- Moves:
  - **Kingside**: King moves 2 squares toward rook, rook jumps over next to king.
  - **Queenside**: King moves 2 squares toward rook (longer move), rook jumps over next to king.

### 2. **En Passant**
- A pawn that moves two squares forward from its starting position can be captured by an enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square.
- Must be done **immediately** on the next move.

### 3. **Promotion**
- When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it must be promoted to a **queen, rook, bishop, or knight** of the same color.
- Most often, the pawn becomes a **queen**.

## 🛡 Objective: Checkmate

- **Check**: The king is under threat of capture.
- **Checkmate**: The king is in check and no legal move can escape the threat. This ends the game.
- **Stalemate**: Player has no legal move, but the king is not in check — this results in a **draw**.

---

## 🤝 Draws

- **Stalemate**
- **Threefold repetition**: Same position occurs three times.
- **Fifty-move rule**: No pawn move or capture in the last 50 consecutive moves.
- **Insufficient material**: Neither player has enough material to force checkmate (e.g., king vs. king, king and bishop vs. king).

---

## 🎯 Winning the Game

You win by:
- **Checkmating** your opponent.
- If your opponent **resigns**.
- Winning on **time** (in timed games).
