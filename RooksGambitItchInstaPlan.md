# 🎯 Rook's Gambit: Soft Launch Plan

This document outlines the quiet-release strategy for **Rook's Gambit**, a minimal chess game project created by Jessop Hunt and hosted on Sketchy Ponderings. The goal is to share the project authentically without pressure or hype, while gently cross-pollinating visibility between your creative hubs (*Fairweather*, *Sketchy Ponderings*, and *itch.io*).

---

## 🕹️ Step 1: Itch.io Release (Link Version)

**Type:** HTML Game (hosted externally)  
**URL:** `https://www.fairweatherproductions.com/sketchy-ponderings/chess.html`  
**Hosting Strategy:** Use the *"external file"* setting in itch.io to link to the live game.

### Draft Description for itch.io Page:

> **Rook's Gambit**  
>  
> A meditative chess game where the music is slow, the moves are deliberate, and the silence between turns might be more important than the checkmate.  
>  
> I made this as a personal experiment—part practice, part presence.  
>  
> Play online (no download needed):  
> [https://www.fairweatherproductions.com/sketchy-ponderings/chess.html](https://www.fairweatherproductions.com/sketchy-ponderings/chess.html)  
>  
> 🎵 Music, code, and design by me.  
>  
> More strange and subtle things at:  
> ✧ [Sketchy Ponderings](https://www.fairweatherproductions.com/sketchy-ponderings)  
> ✧ [Fairweather](https://www.fairweatherproductions.com)
> ✧ [The Second Gaze](https://www.fairweatherproductions.com/second-gaze)

## 📷 Step 2: Instagram Return (Low-Pressure)

After 2–3 years of quiet, this is a way to reappear without expectation—just an honest post from the creative edge.

### Draft Instagram Post:

> ✨ After years of quiet making, I finally finished a thing.  
>  
> It’s called **Rook’s Gambit**, and it’s a chess game—but also a meditation on focus, rhythm, and the subtle energy between moves.  
>  
> You can play it in your browser:  
> [link to itch.io]  
>  
> Built it from scratch. Music, visuals, everything.  
>  
> Felt good to make something start to finish again.  
>  
> If you try it, I’d love to hear how it plays. ♟️  
>

## 🧭 Closing Thought

This is not a launch. It’s a signal.  
A feather on the wind.  
A move made without demand.

You’re showing up. That’s enough.
