# 🧠 Project Overview: Chess - Sketchy Ponderings

A fully interactive, stylized chess experience hosted as part of the *Sketchy Ponderings* series. This page blends atmospheric design, functional chess mechanics, and a minimalist poetic interface into a unique HTML/CSS/JS application.

## 🎨 Visual Design

### 🌌 Ambient Layers
- **`#background`**: Base visual layer, likely styled with gradients or subtle textures.
- **`.mist-overlay`**: Slow-moving parallax mist layer to add dreamy atmospheric depth.
- **`#particles`**: May be intended for a future particle.js background or subtle float animation.

### 📝 Lore Overlay
- **`#gameOverlay` + `#overlayText`**: Poetic, thematic intro message displayed before or during gameplay.
    > "In the Chess Realms, every move echoes through time..."

## ♟️ Game Structure

### 🧱 Layout Containers
- **`#game-container`**: Primary wrapper for the chess interface and controls.
- **`#game-header` + `#gameStatus`**: Section to display current game state (e.g. turn info, check/checkmate messages).
- **`.chess-board-wrapper`**: Contains board and rank/file labels.

### 📐 Coordinate Labels
- **`.rank-labels` & `.file-labels`**: Indicate rows (ranks) and columns (files) for traditional chess referencing.
- **`.rank-label` and `.file-label` (x8 each)**: Individual labels for A–H and 1–8.

### 🧩 Board Implementation
- **`#chessBoard`**: Actual 8x8 board, where tiles and pieces are rendered (likely with JS).
- **`.chess-board-mist`**: Visual enhancement layer over the board for subtle blur/mist effects.

---

## 🕹 Controls and Info

- **`#controls`**: Area reserved for buttons like *Restart Game*, *Undo*, or *Show Last Move*.
- **`#moveHistory`**: Log of player/AI moves, helpful for review or strategy tracking.

---

## 🧠 Instruction Panel

- **`.game-instructions` & `.instruction-grid`**: Section for embedded game tips, guidance, or poetic cues.
- **`.instruction` (x5)**: Individual panels, possibly showing symbolic ideas or gameplay insights.

---

## 🧾 Technical Features

- ✅ Custom layout built entirely with HTML and CSS.
- ✅ One embedded `<style>` block controlling the entire aesthetic.
- ❌ No external `<script>` or linked JS libraries at this point.
- ❌ No `<canvas>` elements used (animations are CSS-based or handled via DOM).
- 🔧 Room to grow: functional scripting (AI, logic) may still be external or yet to be re-added.

## ✨ Expansion Ideas

Already mentioned and still very viable:
- [ ] **Rulebook modal or collapsible section**
- [ ] **Audio toggle (soft move/capture sounds)**
- [ ] **Dynamic themes or visual variants**
- [ ] **"Fog of War" experimental game mode**
- [ ] **AI difficulty levels or two-player toggle**
